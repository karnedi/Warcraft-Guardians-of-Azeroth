To Those Modding Wonders,

    For each wonder you create new icons for, you will need 3 individual icon strips.
    The dimensions for those three strips are listed below.

      Small  - 480 x 96  pixels
      Medium - 660 x 132 pixels
      Large  - 750 x 150 pixels

    For each strip, there are five icons representing the five stages of a wonder's
    construction (0 through 4), from left to right. The dimensions of each separate
    icon are listed below:

      Small  - 96 x 96   pixels
      Medium - 132 x 132 pixels
      Large  - 150 x 150 pixels

    For each icon strip, please use the following naming convention to avoid
    graphic bugs and general disorganization.

      wonder_strip_<Name of Wonder>_<Size of Strip>.dds

    For example, Wyrmrest Temple (wonder_wyrmrest_temple) would have the following
    name for a 480 x 96 icon strip:

      wonder_strip_wyrmrest_temple_small.dds

    Lastly, DO NOT forget to assign each of your three icon strips a separate
    spriteType in interface/wc_wonders.gfx. With the example above, the spriteType
    would be written as such.

      spriteType = {
    		name = "GFX_wonder_strip_wyrmrest_temple_small"
    		texturefile = "gfx\\interface\\wonder_interface\\wonder_strips\\wonder_strip_wyrmrest_temple_small.dds"
    		noOfFrames = 5
    	}

    If your naming conventions are incorrect, the game won't be able to find your
    icons.
